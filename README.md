# Anim_Batch_Save_files
This is a tool used to quickly attach a set of joint animations to a given character, and save out each file to a given directory. 

The script is to be run in Maya and assumes the use of a predetermined naming convention for the animation files.

The user can run the UI script and will be prompted for:
* a character file for the animations to attach to 
* a directory of animation files (in .ma or .mb format)
* a directory path to save to

The batch is saved in .mb format
